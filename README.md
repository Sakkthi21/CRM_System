## Introduction

This CRM Backend System provides a robust foundation for managing customer data in a CRM application. It's built with Node.js and Express, using a relational database (PostgreSQL or MySQL) for data persistence. The system includes essential features like user authentication, CRUD operations for customer management, advanced searching and filtering, and comprehensive error handling.

## Features

### Core Functionality

-   **Customer Management:** Enables full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on customer records.
-   **User Authentication:** Implements secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
-   **Search and Filtering:** Supports searching for customers by name, email, or phone, and filtering by the associated company.
-   **Database:** Utilizes a relational database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) with efficient schema design.
-   **Timestamps:** Automatically manages `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps for customer records.
-   **Error Handling:** Provides thorough input validation and returns meaningful error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes.

### Optional Enhancements

-   **Pagination:** Implements pagination for the customer list API to improve performance when handling large datasets.
-   **Role-Based Access Control:** Supports different roles (Admin and Regular User) to control access to specific API endpoints.
-   **Customer Interactions:** Allows logging and retrieval of interactions (notes, follow-up reminders) related to each customer.

## Technology Stack

-   **Backend Framework:** Express.js
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL/MySQL
-   **ORM:** Sequelize/TypeORM
-   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
-   **Password Hashing:** bcrypt
-   **Validation:** Joi
-   **API Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

-   Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
-   npm or Yarn
-   PostgreSQL or MySQL database server

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

    Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-folder>` with your project's repository URL and folder name, respectively.

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and configure the following environment variables:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432 # Default PostgreSQL port (3306 for MySQL)
DB_USER=<your-db-user>
DB_PASSWORD=<your-db-password>
DB_NAME=<your-db-name>
JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret> # Choose a strong secret key
PORT=3000 # Port on which the server will run
```

-   Replace the placeholder values with your actual database credentials and a strong JWT secret.

### Database Migrations

Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables and relationships:

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate # If using Sequelize
# or
npx typeorm migration:run # If using TypeORM
```

## Running the Application

To start the server, execute the following command:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

The server will start running at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you specified in your `.env` file).

## API Testing

You can test the API endpoints using tools like Postman, Insomnia, or cURL. Refer to the [API Documentation](#api-documentation) section for details on the available endpoints and request/response formats.

## API Endpoints

### User Authentication

-   **POST** `/auth/register`: Registers a new user.
    -   Request Body: `{ "name": "", "email": "", "password": "" }`
-   **POST** `/auth/login`: Logs in an existing user and returns a JWT token.
    -   Request Body: `{ "email": "", "password": "" }`

### Customer Management

-   **POST** `/customers`: Creates a new customer.
    -   Request Body: `{ "name": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "company": "" }`
-   **GET** `/customers`: Retrieves a list of customers. Supports pagination, searching, and filtering.
-   **GET** `/customers/:id`: Retrieves a single customer by ID.
-   **PUT** `/customers/:id`: Updates an existing customer's information.
    -   Request Body: `{ "name": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "company": "" }`
-   **DELETE** `/customers/:id`: Deletes a customer.

### Search and Filtering

-   **GET** `/customers?search=<query>`: Searches for customers by name, email, or phone.
-   **GET** `/customers?company=<companyName>`: Filters customers by their associated company.

### Optional Endpoints

-   **GET** `/customers/:id/interactions`: Retrieves all interactions logged for a specific customer.
-   **POST** `/customers/:id/interactions`: Logs a new interaction for a customer.
    -   Request Body: `{ "note": "", "reminder": "" }`

## API Documentation

The API is documented using the OpenAPI (Swagger) specification. You can access the interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:3000/api-docs` once the server is running. The documentation provides detailed information about each endpoint, including request parameters, request body schemas, and response examples.

## Deployment

To deploy the application to a production environment:

1. **Prepare for Deployment:**
    -   Ensure that all configurations are production-ready.
    -   Update the `.env` file with your production environment variables (database credentials, JWT secret, etc.).

2. **Choose a Hosting Platform:**
    -   Select a platform like Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean, or any other suitable platform.

3. **Deploy:**
    -   Follow the platform-specific deployment instructions. This typically involves connecting your Git repository to the platform and configuring build settings.

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**
    -   Set up the necessary environment variables on your hosting platform.

5. **Access the Deployed API:**
    -   Thoroughly test the deployed API to ensure all functionalities are working as expected.
    -   Update the API documentation with the base URL of your live API.

## Future Improvements

Here are some potential improvements for the future:

-   Implement more advanced search filters and sorting options for customers.
-   Add support for soft deletes, allowing recovery of deleted customer records.
-   Enhance logging and monitoring to track application performance and errors.
-   Develop a frontend application that integrates seamlessly with this backend API.
